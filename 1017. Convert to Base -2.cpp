    Imagine we have a negative base -2, N = -5, what happens then? Which one below do you think is the remainder formula?
    a) -5 = (-2) * 2 + (-1)
    b) -5 = (-2) * 3 + 1
    Guess what? The remainder should always be positive! That means the remainder is 1, not -1. The multiple should be 3, not 2.*/
